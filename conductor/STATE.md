  - "Detached runs remain in flight: `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection` and `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal`; `clinical_phenotypes` still has no run directory or partial output"
  - "If `results.csv` appears for `h5_selection` or `clinical_post_restructure`, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately and capture the hypothesis-relevant readout, but do not update interpretation docs without user direction"
  - "User decision is needed on the paper/story reframe because `shallow_confirm` finalized with weak affect at `tau=1,2` and the shallow lesion is not a clean Damasio dissociation"
next_session_focus: "Surface the weak shallow-confirm result to the user first, then only do one bounded completion check for the remaining detached batches"

<!-- Older entries truncated (was 171 lines) -->

- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Re-read required startup context:
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `conductor/MISSION.md`
  - `conductor/STATE.md`
  - confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
  - re-checked `docs/future/roadmap.md` and `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`359781944` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 06:35 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`388463472` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 07:36 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; no run directory partial was created under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: the active blocker remains user direction on the weak `shallow_confirm` result (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`, shallow lesion not Damasio-like); no interpretation docs were updated in this wake cycle
- DECISION: `clinical_betrayal` partial output is still advancing, `h5_selection` partial output is unchanged from the prior handoff, and `clinical_phenotypes` still has not started writing results
- NEXT: if woken before the user responds, do only one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure`; run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately if a final `results.csv` appears

- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results_partial.csv` (`22091568` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:23 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`107908931` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 17:58 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`129518364` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:12 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `shallow_confirm`: wrapper/children `373967`, `374127`, `374164`, `374165`
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has completed yet
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` partial output appears to have restarted from a smaller file while remaining live; `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced materially since Session 70; `h5_selection` remains unchanged and `clinical_phenotypes` has not created a run directory
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if any `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` for that batch and capture the hypothesis readout before touching interpretation docs

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: Session 92 performed the required startup reread and one bounded detached-run check. No code, docs, or analyses changed because the shallow-confirm blocker still needs user direction.
- In flight: targeted wrappers/workers are still live for `h5_selection` (`373976`, `374138`) and `clinical_post_restructure` (`373989`, `374151`, `374161`); `h5_selection` partial output remains `359781944` bytes at `2026-04-18 06:35 UTC`; `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced to `388463472` bytes at `2026-04-18 07:36 UTC`; `clinical_phenotypes` still has no run directory or partial file.
- Next session should do: wait for user direction first because `shallow_confirm` still contradicts the expected H2/H3 story (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`, shallow lesion not Damasio-like). If woken before a user decision, do only one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure` and analyze immediately if a final `results.csv` appears.
