<!-- Older entries truncated (was 169 lines) -->

- DECISION: the blocker is unchanged; no new implementation or doc-reframe work should start until the user decides how to handle the weak shallow-confirm result
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`395778977` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 08:11 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`431620426` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 09:29 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; no run directory output or partial file present under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has produced a final `results.csv`
- DECISION: `h5_selection` appears stalled relative to the prior check, `clinical_betrayal` is still advancing, and `clinical_phenotypes` still has not emitted any files
- NEXT: wait for user direction first; if woken again before that decision, do only one bounded completion check and analyze immediately if `results.csv` appears for either in-flight batch

- DECISION: the mission stop condition remains active because shallow confirmation finished with weak affect at calibrated depths (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`) and the shallow lesion was not a clean Damasio dissociation
- DECISION: do not start new implementation or rewrite interpretation docs until the user decides whether to reframe the story around the weak shallow result
- NEXT: if the user wants continuation before a narrative decision, only do bounded completion checks for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure` and analyze immediately once a final `results.csv` appears
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results_partial.csv` (`22091568` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:23 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`107908931` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 17:58 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`129518364` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:12 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `shallow_confirm`: wrapper/children `373967`, `374127`, `374164`, `374165`
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has completed yet
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` partial output appears to have restarted from a smaller file while remaining live; `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced materially since Session 70; `h5_selection` remains unchanged and `clinical_phenotypes` has not created a run directory
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if any `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` for that batch and capture the hypothesis readout before touching interpretation docs

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: Session 95 performed the required bounded completion check only. `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced again, `h5_selection` did not, and no new final `results.csv` appeared.
- In flight: targeted wrappers/workers are still live for `h5_selection` (`373976`, `374138`) and `clinical_post_restructure` (`373989`, `374151`, `374161`); `h5_selection` partial output is `395778977` bytes at `2026-04-18 08:11 UTC`; `clinical_betrayal` partial output is `431620426` bytes at `2026-04-18 09:29 UTC`; `clinical_phenotypes` still has no run directory or partial file.
- Next session should do: wait for user direction first because `shallow_confirm` is finalized and still contradicts the expected H2/H3 story (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`, shallow lesion not Damasio-like). If woken before a user decision, do only one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure` and analyze immediately if a final `results.csv` appears.
