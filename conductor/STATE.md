# Research State

## Last Updated
2026-04-18 (Session 87 — shallow_confirm analysis, analysis loader fix, and bounded completion check)

## Session Count
87

- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` now exists (`392152888` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 22:31 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`323798760` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 04:59 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`323740576` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 04:48 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted remaining Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- Fixed an analysis-layer bug exposed by `shallow_confirm`:
  - `scripts/run_analysis.py` was producing duplicated condition rows, blank pairwise cells, and `NaN` ANOVA because CSV loads fragmented mixed numeric/string `condition` identifiers
  - updated [cli/common.py](/tmp/mango-worktree-affect_aif-20260416_165841-206877/cli/common.py:1) to read CSV with `low_memory=False` and normalize mixed condition ids
  - added regression coverage in [tests/test_analysis_semantics.py](/tmp/mango-worktree-affect_aif-20260416_165841-206877/tests/test_analysis_semantics.py:1)
  - validation: `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_semantics.py -v` → 4 passed
- Re-ran analysis for `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` after the loader fix
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` hits the mission stop condition; per-depth affect remains weak rather than substantial at calibrated shallow depth
  - `tau1_affect` vs `tau1_no_affect`: mean payoff `416.66` vs `410.34`, diff `+6.32`, Cohen's `d=0.1489`, `p=0.2936`
  - `tau2_affect` vs `tau2_no_affect`: mean payoff `398.58` vs `390.34`, diff `+8.24`, Cohen's `d=0.1955`, `p=0.1684`
  - the batch-level `hypothesis_tests.json` still reports combined shallow H1 `d=1.126`, but that pooled number should not drive interpretation because the tau-specific contrasts are the mission-critical readout and stay small
- DECISION: shallow lesion is not a clean Damasio dissociation on this architecture
  - payoff: `lesioned` vs `tau1_affect` diff `-41.12`, `d=-0.9642`, `p=1.13e-10`
  - joint accuracy: `lesioned` vs `tau1_affect` diff `-0.0316`, `d=-0.2936`, `p=0.0392`
  - stance accuracy: `lesioned` vs `tau1_affect` diff `-0.0609`, `d=-2.4119`, `p=1.38e-39`
- DECISION: interpretation docs remain unchanged this session because the user preference and mission handoff both require surfacing the contradiction before rewriting the narrative
- NEXT: ask the user how they want to handle the weak shallow-affect / non-Damasio shallow-lesion result, and only continue bounded completion checks plus analysis for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure` in the meantime

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: `shallow_confirm` completed and was analyzed after fixing a mixed-condition CSV loader bug in `run_analysis` support code. The focused regression test `python -m pytest tests/test_analysis_semantics.py -v` now passes.
- In flight: targeted wrappers/workers are still live for `h5_selection` (`373976`, `374138`) and `clinical_post_restructure` (`373989`, `374151`, `374161`); `clinical_phenotypes` still has no run directory.
- Next session should do: surface the contradiction first. `shallow_confirm` shows weak shallow affect (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`) and a non-Damasio shallow lesion (`joint_accuracy d=-0.2936`, `stance_accuracy d=-2.4119` vs `tau1_affect`). After that, do only one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure` and analyze immediately if a `results.csv` appears.
