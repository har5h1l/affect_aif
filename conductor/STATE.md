  - "Do not launch the 100-seed `shallow_confirm` batch or rewrite result-interpretation docs until the user decides whether to treat this as a paper-story reframe or request stronger confirmation"

# Research State

## Last Updated
2026-04-17 (Session 52 — tests pass; fresh shallow smoke completes and still shows weak tau1/tau2 affect signal)

## Session Count
52

### Session 52 codex pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, `conductor/STATE.md`; confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist.
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
  - `docs/experiment/design.md`
- Confirmed cleanup state:
  - `results/clinical_run/` is gone
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` is gone
- Confirmed test status from fresh local run:
  - `python -m pytest tests/ -q` summary: `249 passed, 26 skipped, 3 warnings in 426.97s`
- Verified mission command mismatch:
  - `scripts/run_experiment.py` does not support the `--override` flag shown in `MISSION.md`, so the smoke test used a temporary config with `num_replications=5`.
- Ran fresh shallow confirmation smoke:
  - temp config: `/tmp/shallow_affect_confirm_smoke.vHxNwH.json`
  - command: `python scripts/run_experiment.py --config /tmp/shallow_affect_confirm_smoke.vHxNwH.json --output-dir results --batch-name shallow_confirm_smoke --workers 1`
  - final output: `results/shallow_confirm_smoke/shallow_affect_confirm_smoke_vhxnwh/results.csv`
  - completed rows: `5000`
- Recomputed shallow affect effect sizes from the fresh smoke run using per-seed total payoff:
  - `tau=1`: affect mean `401.2`, no-affect mean `388.0`, diff `+13.2`, Cohen's d `0.230`
  - `tau=2`: affect mean `381.2`, no-affect mean `365.6`, diff `+15.6`, Cohen's d `0.278`
- DECISION: Did not launch the full 100-seed `shallow_confirm` batch because the mission stop condition was hit again on fresh shallow data (`tau1 d < 0.3`).
- NEXT: user must decide whether to treat the shallow contradiction as the new paper story, request a full confirmation run anyway, or redirect the mission.

Auto-generated because session `affect_aif_20260417_004904` hit the max-turn budget.

- Final runner detail: Agent exited without a result event — likely crash or timeout (exit: 0)
- Latest commit on branch: `73d9900 State: record stronger shallow-H1 contradiction from current partial reruns`

### Agent Notes To Carry Forward
- No assistant notes were recoverable from the session log.

### Next Session Should
- Review recent workspace changes, then continue from the existing STATE.md plan.
- Confirm whether the interrupted session's final step completed or needs to be retried.
