  - "If `results.csv` appears for `h5_selection` or `clinical_post_restructure`, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately and capture the hypothesis-relevant readout; do not rewrite interpretation docs without explicit user approval"
  - "Interpretation blocker remains: `shallow_confirm` is finalized and still shows weak affect at `tau=1,2` (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`) and the shallow lesion is not a clean Damasio dissociation"

## Last Updated
2026-04-18 (Session 104 — bounded completion check only; `clinical_betrayal` partial advanced, `h5_selection` still stalled)

## Session Count
104


<!-- Older entries truncated (was 170 lines) -->

- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results_partial.csv`
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv`
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv`
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the launched wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `shallow_confirm`: wrappers/children `373967`, `374127`, `374164`, `374165`

    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrappers/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has completed yet
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if any `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` for that batch and capture the hypothesis readout before touching interpretation docs

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: Session 104 performed the required bounded completion check only. No new final `results.csv` appeared. `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced again, while `h5_selection` remained unchanged and `clinical_phenotypes` still has not started emitting files.
- In flight: targeted wrappers/workers are still live for `h5_selection` (`373976`, `374138`) and `clinical_post_restructure` (`373989`, `374151`, `374161`); `h5_selection` partial output remains `503737288` bytes at `2026-04-18 13:06 UTC`; `clinical_betrayal` partial output is now `539500127` bytes at `2026-04-18 14:19 UTC`; `clinical_phenotypes` still has no partial or final file.
- Next session should do: do only one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` / `clinical_post_restructure`; if a final `results.csv` appears, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately and capture the hypothesis-relevant readout. Otherwise leave the detached runs alone and wait for user direction because `shallow_confirm` still contradicts the expected H2/H3 story (`tau1 d=0.1489`, `tau2 d=0.1955`, shallow lesion not Damasio-like).
