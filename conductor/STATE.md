<!-- Older entries truncated (was 177 lines) -->

### Session 86 status check
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`287823598` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 03:24 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`302145037` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-18 03:52 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes` run directory is still absent
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
  - `pgrep -af` also still showed older unrelated `h1_factorial` / `h4_betrayal` relaunch processes (`209790`, `209792`, `209969`, `209973`, `209985`, `209986`, `283269`, `283274`); these were not touched
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because neither remaining detached Phase 4 batch has produced a `results.csv`
- DECISION: `h5_selection` partial output advanced substantially since the prior handoff, `clinical_betrayal` remains at the previously observed `302145037` bytes, and `clinical_phenotypes` still has not started writing a run directory
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if either `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately for that batch and capture the hypothesis-relevant readout before touching interpretation docs

- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results_partial.csv` (`22091568` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:23 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`107908931` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 17:58 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`129518364` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:12 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `shallow_confirm`: wrapper/children `373967`, `374127`, `374164`, `374165`
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has completed yet
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` partial output appears to have restarted from a smaller file while remaining live; `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced materially since Session 70; `h5_selection` remains unchanged and `clinical_phenotypes` has not created a run directory
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if any `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` for that batch and capture the hypothesis readout before touching interpretation docs

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: one bounded completion check was completed. `h5_selection` remains in progress but its partial file grew to `287823598` bytes (`2026-04-18 03:24 UTC`); `clinical_betrayal` still has no `results.csv` and remains at `302145037` bytes (`2026-04-18 03:52 UTC`); `clinical_phenotypes` still has no run directory.
- In flight: targeted wrappers/workers are still live for `h5_selection` (`373976`, `374138`) and `clinical_post_restructure` (`373989`, `374151`, `374161`).
- Next session should do: one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` and `clinical_post_restructure`, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately if either `results.csv` appears, and keep the existing contradictions visible in handoff: shallow affect is still weak and the shallow lesion is not a clean Damasio dissociation because stance accuracy degrades strongly.
