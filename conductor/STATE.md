# Research State

## Last Updated
2026-04-17 (Session 50 — one bounded completion check done; H2 final csv present, H1/H4 still incomplete, duplicate legacy reruns still alive, stop condition still active)

## Session Count
51

### Session 51 monitor pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree remains dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed the single allowed completion check for detached Phase 3 reruns:
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results.csv` is still missing
  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` is now present
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results.csv` is still missing
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results_partial.csv` is present
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results_partial.csv` is present
  - `pgrep -af` still shows active legacy reruns:
    - wrappers `209790` (`h1_factorial`), `209792` (`h4_betrayal`)
    - python children `209969`, `209973`, `209985`, `209986`
    - duplicate detached python jobs `283269` (`h1_factorial_setsid_20260416`), `283274` (`h4_betrayal_setsid_20260416`)
- DECISION: mission remains blocked because the shallow-H1 contradiction still stands and H1/H4 final outputs are not complete.
- NEXT: wait for user direction before changing docs or launching any new canonical confirmation run.

## Auto Handoff
_Last generated at 2026-04-17T00:58:41Z for session `affect_aif_20260417_004904`._

Auto-generated because session `affect_aif_20260417_004904` hit the max-turn budget.

- Final runner detail: Agent exited without a result event — likely crash or timeout (exit: 0)
- Latest commit on branch: `73d9900 State: record stronger shallow-H1 contradiction from current partial reruns`

### Agent Notes To Carry Forward
- No assistant notes were recoverable from the session log.

### Next Session Should
- Review recent workspace changes, then continue from the existing STATE.md plan.
- Confirm whether the interrupted session's final step completed or needs to be retried.
