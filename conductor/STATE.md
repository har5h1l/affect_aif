  - "If confirmation is desired, let the detached H1/H4 reruns finish or launch one canonical shallow confirmation batch before changing docs or starting Phase 4"
  - "H2 lesion rerun is complete at `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv`, but H1/H4 final csvs are still absent and should not be re-polled repeatedly"
next_session_focus: "Keep the mission blocked pending user direction on the weak shallow-H1 result; if reawakened without new instruction, do at most one completion check for H1/H4 and avoid further polling"

# Research State

## Last Updated
2026-04-17 (Session 50 — one bounded completion check done; H2 final csv present, H1/H4 still incomplete, duplicate legacy reruns still alive, stop condition still active)

## Session Count
50

### Session 50 monitor pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree remains dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one completion check for the detached Phase 3 regeneration jobs:
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results_partial.csv` is present
  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` is present
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results_partial.csv` is present
  - `pgrep -af` still shows the original wrapper/python jobs:
    - wrappers `209790` (`h1_factorial`) and `209792` (`h4_betrayal`)
    - python `209969`, `209985`, `209986` for `h1_factorial`
    - python `209973` for `h4_betrayal`
  - `pgrep -af` also shows older duplicate detached python jobs still alive:
    - `283269` for `h1_factorial_setsid_20260416`
    - `283274` for `h4_betrayal_setsid_20260416`
- No additional polling performed after that single check.

## Auto Handoff
_Last generated at 2026-04-17T00:58:41Z for session `affect_aif_20260417_004904`._

Auto-generated because session `affect_aif_20260417_004904` hit the max-turn budget.

- Final runner detail: Agent exited without a result event — likely crash or timeout (exit: 0)
- Latest commit on branch: `73d9900 State: record stronger shallow-H1 contradiction from current partial reruns`

### Agent Notes To Carry Forward
- No assistant notes were recoverable from the session log.

### Next Session Should
- Review recent workspace changes, then continue from the existing STATE.md plan.
- Confirm whether the interrupted session's final step completed or needs to be retried.
