### Session 33 monitor pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree remains dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one completion check for the detached Phase 3 regeneration jobs:
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results_partial.csv` is present
  - `pgrep -af '209790|209791|209792|scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/(h1_factorial|h2_lesion_dissociation|h4_betrayal_recovery)\\.json'` returned no detached run wrappers or matching python children
- DECISION: Per session budget and handoff instructions, stopped after this single completion check without extra polling or reanalysis.

  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` still missing
