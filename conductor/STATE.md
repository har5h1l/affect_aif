### Session 80 analysis fix + bounded run check
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` present (`392152888` bytes, `2026-04-17 22:31 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` present (`215857508` bytes, `2026-04-17 23:58 UTC`); `results.csv` still missing
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` present (`237400531` bytes, `2026-04-18 00:51 UTC`); `results.csv` still missing
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes` still absent
  - `pgrep -af` still showed the `h5_selection` and `clinical_post_restructure` wrappers/workers live
- Implemented analysis-path fixes so completed large runs no longer stall before summary exports:
  - pre-aggregated trajectory plots in `analysis/plots.py` instead of pushing raw 100k-row traces through seaborn with repeated on-the-fly aggregation
  - removed quadratic scheduled-switch rescans in `analysis/metrics.py` by indexing observed/scheduled events once per results table
  - narrowed `has_switch_events()` to scheduled betrayal-style switches rather than all spontaneous volatility switches
  - gated H3/H4/H5 switch-window logic in `analysis/hypotheses.py` so non-betrayal runs do not pay the cost of unavailable betrayal metrics
  - cached `has_switch_events(results)` once in `scripts/run_analysis.py`
- Verified fixes:
  - `python -m pytest tests/ -v` → `249 passed, 26 skipped, 3 warnings in 536.66s`
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py::test_betrayal_metrics_and_analysis_outputs tests/test_supported_surface.py::test_targeted_reanalysis_cli_writes_requested_outputs tests/test_analysis_semantics.py::test_h1_exports_canonical_label_and_summary_frame_uses_it -v` → `3 passed`
  - `python scripts/run_analysis.py --results results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv --output-dir results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/figures` now completes successfully in about 1m34s wall time
- Recovered the missing `shallow_confirm` summary artifacts under `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/figures/`:
  - `final_round_summary.csv`
  - `pairwise_payoff_tests.csv`
  - `hypothesis_tests.json`
  - `hypothesis_summary.csv`
  - `affective_movement_summary.csv`
  - `statistics_summary.txt`
- DECISION: the earlier “analysis stalled after figure_7” issue was an analysis-implementation bottleneck, not corrupted results; the completed `shallow_confirm` batch is now analyzable through the standard CLI again
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` still preserves the contradiction recorded in prior sessions; no interpretation docs were edited
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check for `h5_selection` and `clinical_post_restructure`; if either now has `results.csv`, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` immediately and record the hypothesis-relevant readout before any doc edits

- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree was dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one bounded completion check for the detached Phase 4 runs:
  - `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results_partial.csv` (`22091568` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:23 UTC`)
  - `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/h5_selection/h5_partner_selection/results_partial.csv` (`107908931` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 17:58 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results.csv` still missing; partial output present at `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_betrayal/results_partial.csv` (`129518364` bytes, timestamp `2026-04-17 19:12 UTC`)
  - `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes/results.csv` still missing; run directory still absent under `results/clinical_post_restructure/clinical_phenotypes`
  - `pgrep -af` confirms the targeted Phase 4 wrappers and worker processes remain live:
    - `shallow_confirm`: wrapper/children `373967`, `374127`, `374164`, `374165`
    - `h5_selection`: wrapper/child `373976`, `374138`
    - `clinical_post_restructure`: wrapper/children `373989`, `374151`, `374161`
- DECISION: no analysis or doc updates are available in this wake cycle because none of the detached Phase 4 batches has completed yet
- DECISION: `shallow_confirm` partial output appears to have restarted from a smaller file while remaining live; `clinical_betrayal` partial output advanced materially since Session 70; `h5_selection` remains unchanged and `clinical_phenotypes` has not created a run directory
- NEXT: on the next wake, do one bounded completion check again; if any `results.csv` exists, run `scripts/run_analysis.py` for that batch and capture the hypothesis readout before touching interpretation docs

## Auto Handoff

- What changed: fixed the analysis bottlenecks in `analysis/plots.py`, `analysis/metrics.py`, `analysis/hypotheses.py`, and `scripts/run_analysis.py`. The standard `run_analysis.py` CLI now completes on `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/results.csv` and has restored the missing summary artifacts under `results/shallow_confirm/shallow_affect_confirm/figures/`.
- In flight: `h5_selection` and `clinical_post_restructure` wrappers/workers were still live during this wake; `h5_selection` still only had `results_partial.csv` (`215857508` bytes, `2026-04-17 23:58 UTC`), `clinical_betrayal` still only had `results_partial.csv` (`237400531` bytes, `2026-04-18 00:51 UTC`), and `clinical_phenotypes` still had no run directory.
- Next session should do: one bounded completion check for the detached experiment runs, analyze any newly completed batch immediately, and keep the weak shallow-affect contradiction visible in handoff without changing interpretation docs unless the user asks.
