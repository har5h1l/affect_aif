  - "User decision still needed: H1 shallow contradiction persists in `results/reanalysis/h1_shallow_reanalysis.txt` with tau1 d=0.011 and tau2 d=0.074 from the best available checkpoint data"
  - "If confirmation is desired, let the detached H1/H4 reruns finish or launch one canonical shallow confirmation batch before changing docs or starting Phase 4"
  - "H2 lesion rerun finished and produced `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv`, but H1/H4 remain incomplete and should not be re-polled repeatedly"
next_session_focus: "Hold on the post-restructure narrative until the user chooses how to handle the weak shallow-H1 signal; if reawakened without new direction, do at most one completion check for H1/H4 and avoid further polling"

# Research State

## Last Updated
2026-04-17 (Session 41 — one completion check done; H2 full CSV landed, H1/H4 still incomplete, stop condition still active)

## Session Count
41


<!-- Older entries truncated (was 193 lines) -->

### Session 41 monitor pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree remains dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one completion check for the detached regeneration jobs:
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results_partial.csv` present and updated at `2026-04-17 02:47:56 UTC`
  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` now present (`357103649` bytes, updated `2026-04-17 01:08:51 UTC`)
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results_partial.csv` present and last updated at `2026-04-17 02:31:01 UTC`
  - `pgrep -af` still shows live H1/H4 wrapper/python processes plus the older `*_setsid_20260416` detached python runs
- DECISION: mission stop condition remains active because the shallow-H1 contradiction is still unresolved and the missing H1/H4 full outputs do not provide new user direction
- NEXT: do not change the narrative or launch Phase 4 work unless the user explicitly wants to proceed despite weak shallow-H1 evidence

  - `docs/experiment/results.md`

## Auto Handoff
_Last generated at 2026-04-17T00:58:41Z for session `affect_aif_20260417_004904`._

Auto-generated because session `affect_aif_20260417_004904` hit the max-turn budget.

- Final runner detail: Agent exited without a result event — likely crash or timeout (exit: 0)
- Latest commit on branch: `73d9900 State: record stronger shallow-H1 contradiction from current partial reruns`

### Agent Notes To Carry Forward
- No assistant notes were recoverable from the session log.

### Next Session Should
- Review recent workspace changes, then continue from the existing STATE.md plan.
- Confirm whether the interrupted session's final step completed or needs to be retried.
