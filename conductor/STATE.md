  - "User decision needed: H1 shallow contradiction persists in current partials; the more complete H1 setsid batch shows tau1 affect d=-0.006 (100 tau1_no_affect seeds, 41 tau1_affect seeds)"
  - "If confirmation is desired, let the detached H1/H2/H4 reruns finish or relaunch a single canonical batch before changing docs or starting Phase 4"
  - "H4 betrayal window remains unusable from current partials because only tau4_no_affect has reached round 60 (8 seeds main, 2 seeds setsid)"
next_session_focus: "Wait for user direction on the shallow-H1 contradiction; do not advance to Phase 4 or rewrite the narrative without confirmation"

<!-- Older entries truncated (was 192 lines) -->

### Session 38 monitor + partial-analysis pass
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `conductor/MISSION.md`, and `conductor/STATE.md`
- Confirmed `conductor/INBOX.md` does not exist
- Re-checked phase docs:
  - `docs/future/roadmap.md`
  - `docs/experiment/results.md`
- Checked branch state:
  - `git status --short --branch` → `## analysis/post-restructure-reframe`
  - working tree remains dirty only from `conductor/STATE.md`
- Performed one completion check for the detached Phase 3 regeneration jobs:
  - `results/h1_factorial/h1_depth_affect_factorial/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h2_lesion/h2_lesion_dissociation/results.csv` still missing
  - `results/h4_betrayal/h4_betrayal_recovery/results.csv` still missing
  - partial CSVs now exist for the main and `*_setsid_20260416` reruns of H1/H2/H4
  - running processes still present:
    - original wrappers `209790`, `209791`, `209792`
    - original python children `209969`, `209972`, `209973`, `209985`, `209986`
    - additional `setsid` python runs `283269`, `283271`, `283274`
- Extracted lightweight seed-level summaries from current partials:
  - H1 main partial: `tau1_no_affect` 58 complete seeds, `tau1_affect` 15 complete seeds, `d=0.264`
  - H1 `setsid` partial: `tau1_no_affect` 100 complete seeds, `tau1_affect` 41 seeds (rounds 130-199), `d=-0.006`
  - No `tau2_*` seeds are present yet in either H1 partial, so the shallow H1 contradiction is still unresolved in the direction of "weak/no tau1 effect"
  - H2 main partial: `tau4_no_affect` 100 seeds, `tau4_affect` 100 seeds, `lesioned` 100 seeds; payoff `d(lesioned vs tau4_no_affect)=0.000`, `d(tau4_affect vs lesioned)=0.256`
  - H2 `setsid` partial is still incomplete (`tau4_affect` only 16 seeds; no `lesioned` yet)
  - H4 window partial remains unusable: only `tau4_no_affect` has reached round 60 (`8` seeds main, `2` seeds setsid), so no affect-vs-no-affect recovery estimate is available
- DECISION: stop condition still applies. Do not advance to Phase 4 or refresh interpretation docs without explicit user approval.
