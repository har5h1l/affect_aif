# AGENTS.md — System Documentation

This document provides comprehensive system documentation for AI agents operating on the affect_aif codebase. It covers architecture, module interfaces, experiment pipeline, and operational procedures.

## Documentation First

- Read `docs/active/README.md`, `docs/active/state.md`,
  `docs/active/progress.md`, and `docs/active/blockers.md` before taking over
  a research or restructure task.
- Read `docs/handoffs/` only when a handoff is named, linked, newly created,
  or directly matched to the task. Handoffs are task-specific transfer packets,
  not part of the default active-doc read order.
- Read `docs/theory/goals.md`, `docs/theory/hypotheses.md`, and `docs/theory/pomdp_spec.md` before changing computational claims, affect dynamics, terminal values, or the interpretation of results.
- Read `docs/decisions/architecture.md` before changing factorized controls, policy priors, learning hooks, or pymdp/JAX alignment claims.
- Read `docs/experiment/design.md` before changing task design, configs, variants, metrics, or sensitivity sweeps.
- Read `docs/design/implementation.md` before changing environment semantics, switching logic, or analysis helpers.
- Read `README.md` before changing setup, entry points, or repo layout.

## Graphify Context First

- For any non-trivial codebase task, use Graphify for orientation before broad raw-file exploration. Start with the Graphify MCP server when available (for example `god_nodes` and `shortest_path` around user-named concepts), then use the graph results to choose which files to inspect.
- Before architecture or codebase-navigation questions, read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` if it exists.
- If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, navigate from there before opening many raw files.
- Treat Graphify as the map and raw files/tests as the source of truth for exact behavior, edits, and line references.
- If Graphify is missing, stale, or unavailable, say so explicitly and continue with targeted raw-file search.
- After modifying code structure, refresh the graph:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python 2>/dev/null || printf python3) -c "from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code; from pathlib import Path; _rebuild_code(Path('.'))"
```

## Required Follow-Through

- If code behavior changes, update the relevant docs in the same change.
- If experiment assumptions change, update both theory-facing and experiment-facing docs.
- If configs or scripts change, update the README or implementation notes so the runnable workflow stays accurate.
- If tests reveal a theory/code mismatch, fix both the implementation and the docs before closing the task.

## Learned User Preferences

- Before updating result-interpretation docs from new experiment outputs, ask the user first.
- When the user asks about branch state, merge readiness, or pruning stale remote branches, run git (fetch or prune as needed) and summarise concrete outputs instead of only listing commands.
- For active-doc-driven research, treat `docs/active/state.md` as the source of truth for phase autonomy; do not default to “blocked” framing when the mission tells the agent to proceed or to choose the next phase.
- For manuscript work, keep pending experiment work in `docs/active`; use confirmed results and placeholders in the manuscript, do not invent results or alter core technical content, and do not state that experiments still need to run.
- In manuscript prose, use partner-local β_k versus shared β (not "global beta"); use "exploratory diagnostic" not "smoke" or "post-fix" in reader-facing text.
- Manuscript figure captions describe plotted panels only; soften partner-allocation claims until allocation rates are final.
- Use American English spelling in the manuscript (behavior, modeling, formalize, characterize, etc.).
- In manuscript phenotype claims, use "computational phenotype", "computational analogue", or "phenotype-inspired computational variants" — not clinical validation, diagnosis, or "clinical-style".
- When manuscript framing changes, update supporting paper docs under `docs/paper/` (notes, README, planning docs) to match; do not silently rewrite `docs/results/` interpretation.
- When syncing to mango while remote experiments are running, do not stop or disrupt active sessions.
- Prefer hard renames without legacy code paths or deprecation aliases.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Use `.venv` in project root; venv should auto-activate when in this folder (direnv with `.envrc`).
- Recommended experiment run: queue the relevant TOML specs under `configs/trust/hypotheses/` in one batch with `--workers 1` unless the user explicitly authorizes more workers; results go under `results/<batch_name>/<hypothesis_id>/<experiment_id>/results.csv`; run `scripts/analysis/analyze.py` on those paths after.
- Random-assignment specs are weak discriminators for the current hypothesis spine; use agent-choice scheduled-stance-switch specs for stress-response results.
- Official `inferactively-pymdp==1.0.0` is the supported runtime. Do not reintroduce a custom active-inference engine; keep affect and trust logic in task modules.
- State inference (partner-type belief updating) is handled by official
  `pymdp.Agent` instances created from `tasks.trust.pomdp` templates and logged
  as matrix-based belief updates.
- Benchmark runs use `scripts/benchmark/run.py` plus `docs/operations/benchmark.md` for trust-task evaluation arena TOML configs such as `configs/benchmark/e1_arena/default.toml` and `configs/benchmark/e1_arena/betrayal.toml`.
- Primary trust-hypothesis configs are under `configs/trust/hypotheses/` (and smoke under `configs/trust/smoke/`); benchmark configs are benchmark-family TOML specs under `configs/benchmark/`—see `docs/experiments/manifest.md`.
- Remote VMs, sync, and merge flows for this project use `mango` (CLI at `~/Desktop/mango/`, available globally). See "Mango" section in `CLAUDE.md` for full command reference. Key: `mango run affect_aif --cloud` to launch, `mango stop affect_aif --remote` to stop, `mango cloud sync push/fetch affect_aif` to sync code/results (`sync push` is rsync and does not delete remote-only files under `results/`). Do not add orchestration or deployment scripts to this repo.
- Manuscript PDF builds in `docs/paper/manuscript/` via `pdflatex` → `bibtex` → `pdflatex` × 2; output is `main.pdf`. Supplementary code link (`https://github.com/har5h1l/affect_aif`, placeholder for anonymous review) belongs in Appendix C (`appendix/appendix_c_protocols.tex`) after seed counts; update URL upon acceptance.
- Phenotype experiment summaries for the paper live in `docs/paper/manuscript/source_tables/` with figures in `docs/paper/manuscript/figures/`.

### Experiment Variants

Trust experiments are declared as TOML specs under
`configs/trust/hypotheses/`. Each spec expands explicit `[[variants]]`
instead of numeric condition IDs or presets.

Core maintained variant knobs:

| Field | Examples | Meaning |
|----|------|-------|
| `affect` | `none`, `precision`, `tracked_only` | Runtime affect mode |
| `planning_horizon` | `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` | Native pymdp policy horizon |
| `epistemic_value` | `true`, `false` | Whether policy inference uses information gain |
| `alpha_charge`, `initial_beta`, `beta_persistence`, `beta_levels` | numeric / arrays | Affective precision dynamics |

## Configuration System

Trust specs live in `configs/trust/hypotheses/`, smoke specs live in
`configs/trust/smoke/`, benchmark specs live under `configs/benchmark/`,
and multi-focal configs currently live in `experiments/multifocal/configs/`. `ExperimentConfig` is now an internal runtime adapter derived from
expanded TOML runs. Key runtime fields:

### Game Structure
- `payoff_mode`: "binary" | "graded"
- `num_partners`: default 4
- `num_rounds`: default 200
- `assignment_mode`: "random" | "agent_choice"
- `scheduled_stance_switches`: list of stance-shift events for betrayal-style scenarios

### Agent Parameters
- `planning_horizon`: planning depth, supplied by each variant before runtime construction
- `alpha_charge`: prediction error scaling (3.0)
- `sigma_0_sq`: prior variance (0.25)
- `initial_beta`: starting precision prior (1.0)
- `beta_num_levels`: number of discrete beta support points (default 5)
- `beta_persistence`: transition persistence for the beta posterior (0.8)
- `gamma`: base policy precision before partner-local beta modulation

### Run Parameters
- `replications`: seeds per variant in TOML experiment metadata
- `random_seed`: base seed
- `[[sweeps]]`: optional explicit variant-parameter expansion

## Analysis Outputs

`scripts/analysis/analyze.py --results <csv> --output-dir <dir>` produces:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `final_round_summary.csv` | Per-seed cumulative payoffs and accuracy |
| `pairwise_payoff_tests.csv` | All variant pairs: t-stat, p-value, Cohen's d |
| `hypothesis_tests.json` | Structured hypothesis test results |
| `hypothesis_summary.csv` | One-row-per-hypothesis overview |
| `affective_movement_summary.csv` | Beta / precision-signal range per seed |
| `statistics_summary.txt` | ANOVA + movement + betrayal summaries |
| `betrayal_*.csv` | (if switch events) Post-switch window analysis |
| `*.png` | Figures: payoff distributions, beta trajectories, etc. |

## Key Invariants

1. **Sophisticated inference**: Policy evaluation uses observation-branching, not mean-field rollout
2. **Native pymdp boundary**: policy/state inference stays inside official `pymdp.Agent`; task code only constructs matrices and manages partner-local beta/gamma
3. **Focal AIF, scripted partners**: reported trust experiments use a focal active-inference agent against environment-side parameterized partner policies; partners do not run `pymdp.Agent` or affective precision (see `docs/theory/pomdp_spec.md` §12)
4. **Deterministic seeds**: `random_seed + replication_index` ensures reproducibility
5. **Variant equality**: same-horizon no-affect and tracked-only variants should match when precision is decoupled
6. **Binary saturation**: EFE gaps ~10.83 in binary game → softmax is hard argmax → precision modulation inert
7. **Graded activation**: q_pi_entropy ~5.8 in graded game → precision modulation channel active

## Troubleshooting

### Tests fail after code change
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_package_surface.py tests/test_supported_surface.py -q  # supported package surface
```

### Experiment produces unexpected results
1. Run with `--verbose --verbosity-mode stage_stream` for per-round tracing
2. Check beta/gamma traces and `q_pi_entropy` in the per-round results
3. Check current state in `docs/active/blockers.md`
4. Compare against current and historical status in `docs/results/`

### Analysis script errors
- Check CSV has expected columns: `variant_id`, `seed`, `round`, and `payoff`
- Filter or group by `variant_id` for hypothesis comparisons
